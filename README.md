# Hangman Game
This is a simple hangman game written in Java. This program was written in 2018.

# Version 1.0
This is the base version of the game. [Executable .jar file](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/Hangman-Game/blob/main/Java%20Hangman%20Version%201.0.jar)

# Version 1.1
This is the same as the base version of the game, however, there is a recursive function to select the Java vocabulary words instead of just direct random selection.

## How to use:
Download the attached executable .jar application and execute and the java-based GUI will start-up. Alternately, the program can also be run by downloading the source code and compiling/executing each java class via a command line/IDE or the classes for the source code can be introduced into the Eclipse IDE and exported as a .jar executable.

## How to play:

Start the program, and an introduction prompt will appear.

A game screen will popup with a randomly generated java-themed word in the game

to play: simply select a letter (this functions as a guest) and a prompt will either state "incorrect guess"

this process continues until the player wins
